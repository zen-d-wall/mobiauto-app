# The App
Please refer to this link in order to access the app: https://mobiauto-app.vercel.app/

## The Purpose
The Mobiauto App is a simple web app that allows users to quickly look up for prices of all Vehicles available in the Mobiauto API.

## How it works?
Using NextJS and Context API, I tried to optimize it as much as I could so not only the app, but also the code would be simple to understand.

## Source
All the data and content seeing in the Mobiauto app comes from Fipe API: https://deividfortuna.github.io/fipe/v2/
